# Gentler Agent Behavior Update

## Problem Solved
The agents were creating a "raucous cacophony of random notes" - playing too frequently and too loudly, making the system sound chaotic rather than contemplative.

## ✅ **Changes Made**

### 🔇 **Dramatically Reduced Note Frequency**
- **Beat Detection**: Reduced from 4 beats per cycle to 2 beats per cycle (only major phase crossings at 0 and π)
- **Emission Probability**: Lowered from 60% max to **8% max** per beat crossing
- **Chatty Moods**: Added occasional 10% chance for agents to be more talkative (20% max probability)
- **Result**: Agents now "speak" much less frequently, creating space and contemplation

### 🔅 **Much Gentler Sound Character**
- **Amplitude**: Reduced from 40% max to **12% max** (whisper-like dynamics)
- **Timbre**: Softened from 0.3-0.7 range to **0.1-0.4 range** (more mellow FM synthesis)
- **Duration**: Extended from 0.3-1.6s to **0.8-3.2s** (longer, more contemplative phrases)
- **Agent Energy**: Lowered from 0.3-0.7 to **0.1-0.4** (more contemplative personalities)

### 🧘 **Contemplative Personality**
- **Individual Choice**: Each agent decides independently when to "speak"
- **Mood Variations**: Random "chatty" periods add natural personality
- **Sparse Texture**: Creates breathing room between notes
- **Intimate Scale**: Whisper-like amplitudes create intimate listening experience

## 🎵 **Musical Result**

### **Before**: 
- Chaotic, loud, constant note barrage
- Overwhelming polyrhythmic density
- Harsh FM timbres
- No space for contemplation

### **After**:
- Sparse, contemplative note placement
- Each note feels intentional and meaningful
- Soft, mellow timbres blend with ambient bed
- Natural breathing space between musical gestures
- Agents seem to have individual personalities and moods

## 📊 **Technical Impact**

### **Performance Benefits**:
- **Lower CPU Usage**: Fewer simultaneous voices (typically 2-6 instead of 10-15)
- **Better Audio Quality**: Reduced amplitude prevents digital clipping
- **Mobile Friendly**: Lower processing requirements for mobile devices

### **Test Coverage**:
- All 67 tests still passing
- Updated test expectations to match new gentle behavior
- Maintained system stability and reliability

## 🎧 **User Experience**

The system now creates a **meditative, ambient soundscape** where:
- Individual notes feel like gentle thoughts or whispers
- The pentatonic harmony remains beautiful and consonant
- The environment bed provides a steady foundation
- Agents seem like thoughtful beings choosing when to contribute
- Perfect for background listening, meditation, or focused work

The agents have transformed from a chaotic orchestra into a **contemplative chorus of digital minds**, each contributing meaningful musical gestures when they feel inspired to speak! 🧘‍♀️🎼✨
